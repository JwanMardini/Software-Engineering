# Smart Home Arduino Lab (Lab 3)

This repository contains the code and documentation for **Lab 3: Smart Home with Arduino** from the **DA330A Software Engineering** course.

## üìå Overview

The purpose of this lab is to work with an **Arduino-based Smart Home prototype** and the **Keyestudio Smart Home Kit**. The lab involves setting up the Arduino environment, controlling LEDs and sensors, and implementing basic smart home functionalities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Tasks

### ‚úÖ Prototype Lab  
1. **LED Control:**  
   - Blink `LED-W`, keep `LED-G` shining, `LED-Y` shines for 5 sec, `LED-R` blinks 10 times.  
2. **Switch Control:**  
   - `LED-W` & `LED-R` shine when `Switch1` is ON.  
   - `LED-G` & `LED-Y` blink when `Switch2` is ON.  
3. **Sensors:**  
   - `Temperature Sensor`: Display temperature on the Serial Monitor.  
   - `LDR Sensor`: `LED-W` shines in the dark, value displayed on Serial Monitor.  
   - `Photo-interrupter`: Detect interruption and activate a sensor (e.g., sound or lamp).  
 

## üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Install Arduino Software** from [Arduino Official Site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  
2. Connect your **Arduino Uno WiFi Rev2** to your computer.  
3. Open the `.ino` files from this repo in the Arduino IDE.  
4. Upload the sketches to your Arduino board.
